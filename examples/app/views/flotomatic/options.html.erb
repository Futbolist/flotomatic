    <h1>Flotomatic Setting Options</h1>

    <p>There are plenty of options you can set to control the precise
    looks of your plot. You can control the axes, the legend, the
    default graph type, the look of grid, etc.</p>

    <p>The idea is that Flot goes to great lengths to provide <b>sensible
    defaults</b> which you can then customize as needed for your
    particular application. If you've found a use case where the
    defaults can be improved, please don't hesitate to give your
    feedback.</p>
